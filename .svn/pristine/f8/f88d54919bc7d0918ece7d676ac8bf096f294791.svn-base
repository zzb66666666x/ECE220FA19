1. Provide C code to declare a variable "s" which is an array of 4 structures with members "int" and "double".


2. Declare the same variable "s" (an array of 4 structures with members "int" and "double"), this time using a custom type to identify the structure.



3. What does the type of "a" change to when it's used in expression 1?


4. What is the result of all four expressions? Why?


5. You have a variable with type "int" that you want to pass to a function, but the parameter has type "int *". How do you pass it? What if the parameter has type "int **"?


6. Suppose you have a variable called "vector_array" which is an array of this "vector" type. Write a C expression to access the y component of element 4 of the array (element 0 is the first).


7. If we have a variable "cur_ball" which is a pointer to a "ball", how would we access the x velocity of the ball? What if we had an array of "ball" called "balls" and wanted to access the y position of ball 0?


8. Explain why "&array[3]" and "array + 3" are equivalent.


9. Explain why this trick works.
